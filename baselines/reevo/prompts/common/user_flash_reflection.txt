### List heuristics
Below is a list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst.

### Guide
- Keep in mind: List of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:** (<150 words).
Example: "Comparing 'problem_iter1_code2.py' (best) to 'problem_iter1_code3.py' (worst), we see ... Secondly, 'problem_iter1_code4.py' (second best) is better than 'problem_iter1_code6.py' (second worst) because ... Finally, 'problem_iter1_code5.py' (third best) outperforms 'problem_iter1_code3.py' (worst) ...",

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

I'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step.
