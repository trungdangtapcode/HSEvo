### Good self-reflections
Here is synthesis of effective self-reflections:
{good_reflection}

### Bad self-reflection
Here is synthesis of ineffective self-reflections:
{bad_reflection}

### Current self-reflection
Here is synthesis of current self-reflections:
{curr_reflection}

Let's synthesize Current self-reflection and Good self-reflections, paying attention to avoid Bad self-reflection, in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.
Response (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.

I'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step.
