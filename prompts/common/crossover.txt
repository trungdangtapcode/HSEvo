### Better code
{func_signature_m1}
{code_method1}

### Worse code
{func_signature_m2}
{code_method2}

### Analyze & experience
- {analyze}
- {exp}

Your task is to write an improved function `{func_name}_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.
Output the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.

I'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step.
